      Located on the coast of Italy's Strait of Messina, Villa San Giovanni is a small unassuming town in the
      southernmost Italian province of Reggio Calabria. Once known for its mulberry crop and silkworm breeding, the
      area is now known for the colorful festival of the Saints Cosma and Damiano. It has also become a temporary
      home for a group of three refugees fleeing from Libya.
      Mudiaga, 29, Seykou, 20, and Lamin, 18, made the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean Sea to Italy after
      mounting chaos and violence in Libya they said forced them to flee.

      The three now live in a four story concrete building in Villa San Giovanni provided by an Italian resettlement
      organization called SPRAR. The apartment is sparsely decorated with secondhand mattresses, suitcases and neatly
      stacked piles of sparse personal possessions - a New York yankees hat, a 2003 Bob Marley calendar, a hardcover
      Bible, a pair of brightly colored soccer cleats.

      <b>The Situation in Libya</b>
      <br><br>
      <p>They have all had incredible journeys. Seykou, ambitious and well-spoken, left his home in Gambia and traveled
      through Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger before arriving in Libya in 2011. Mudiaga made a similar journey
      to Libya from Nigeria in 2007 and Lamin from Gambia in 2012.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Before the war started, many people from neighboring African countries were moving to Libya in search of work.
      They found jobs as mechanics, bricklayers, plumbers, and construction workers, jobs that middle and upper class
      Libyans were gladly handing off to undocumented laborers. The 2011 uprising, overthrow, and subsequent murder
      of Muammar Gaddafi initially spurred promises of democracy and further economic opportunity for the country;
      however, those promises were quickly replaced with a brutal civil war and political chaos. </p>

        <br>routes of 3 men to Libya
      </div>

      <p>Mudiaga moved to Libya in February of 2007. He quickly found work at a small company in the capital of Tripoli
      doing welding and fabrication work. He says he found great satisfaction in his work and was also able able to put
      some money aside, something he had not been able to do at home in Nigeria. However, after the collapse of the
      government, the company where Mudiaga worked abruptly shut down along with the availability of economic opportunity.
      "When the war started, everything just finished. It is a big war with machine guns and bullets flying,"
      said Mudiaga.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Lamin was in Libya for one year and four months and like Mudiaga found steady employment that allowed him to
      send money to his family in Gambia. "I decided to leave Gambia to have something for my family. First, I was in
      Senegal working, but there money is not powerful. So that's why I went to Libya because the money is like
      Europe." He said when he first arrived there was a break in fighting, but about a year into his stay, the fighting between
      the divided factions started up again, making it unsafe for him to leave his home.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Seykou moved to Libya in 2011 to join his family who had started working in the country. He said that in the beginning,
      life in Libya was nice. He enjoyed being there and being close to his family. However, one day on his
      way to work, Seykou was kidnapped and thrown into prison. "I was in prison for three months. I decided to come
      here (to Italy) to save my life. Before, there was no war there. Everybody was equal in Libya. By the time war
      started, black people had no chance...So from there, I decided to sacrifice my life. If I survive or dead. And God
      help me, I survived," said Seykou.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      As the fighting worsened, all three men made the same choice that thousands of others in search of a better life
      make each year - to leave Libya and take the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean into Europe. The political
      climate in Libya provided a perfect opportunity for smugglers to move people freely across the Mediterranean
      into Italy. </p>
