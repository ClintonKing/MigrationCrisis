      Located on the coast of Italy's Strait of Messina, Villa San Giovanni is a small unassuming town in the
      southernmost Italian province of Reggio Calabria. Once known for its mulberry crop and silkworm breeding, the
      area is now known for the colorful festival of the Saints Cosma and Damiano. It has also become a temporary
      home for a group of three refugees fleeing from Libya.
      Mudiaga, 29, Seykou, 20, and Lamin, 18, made the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean Sea to Italy after
      mounting chaos and violence in Libya they said forced them to flee.

      The three now live in a four story concrete building in Villa San Giovanni provided by an Italian resettlement
      organization called SPRAR. The apartment is sparsely decorated with secondhand mattresses, suitcases and neatly
      stacked piles of sparse personal possessions - a New York yankees hat, a 2003 Bob Marley calendar, a hardcover
      Bible, a pair of brightly colored soccer cleats.

      <p>They have all had incredible journeys. Seykou, ambitious and well-spoken, left his home in Gambia and traveled
      through Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger before arriving in Libya in 2011. Mudiaga made a similar journey
      to Libya from Nigeria in 2007 and Lamin from Gambia in 2012.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Before the war started, many people from neighboring African countries were moving to Libya in search of work.
      They found jobs as mechanics, bricklayers, plumbers, and construction workers, jobs that middle and upper class
      Libyans were gladly handing off to undocumented laborers. The 2011 uprising, overthrow, and subsequent murder
      of Muammar Gaddafi initially spurred promises of democracy and further economic opportunity for the country;
      however, those promises were quickly replaced with a brutal civil war and political chaos. </p>

        <br>routes of 3 men to Libya
      </div>

      <p>Mudiaga moved to Libya in February of 2007. He quickly found work at a small company in the capital of Tripoli
      doing welding and fabrication work. He says he found great satisfaction in his work and was also able able to put
      some money aside, something he had not been able to do at home in Nigeria. However, after the collapse of the
      government, the company where Mudiaga worked abruptly shut down along with the availability of economic opportunity.
      "When the war started, everything just finished. It is a big war with machine guns and bullets flying,"
      said Mudiaga.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Lamin was in Libya for one year and four months and like Mudiaga found steady employment that allowed him to
      send money to his family in Gambia. "I decided to leave Gambia to have something for my family. First, I was in
      Senegal working, but there money is not powerful. So that's why I went to Libya because the money is like
      Europe." He said when he first arrived there was a break in fighting, but about a year into his stay, the fighting between
      the divided factions started up again, making it unsafe for him to leave his home.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Seykou moved to Libya in 2011 to join his family who had started working in the country. He said that in the beginning,
      life in Libya was nice. He enjoyed being there and being close to his family. However, one day on his
      way to work, Seykou was kidnapped and thrown into prison. "I was in prison for three months. I decided to come
      here (to Italy) to save my life. Before, there was no war there. Everybody was equal in Libya. By the time war
      started, black people had no chance...So from there, I decided to sacrifice my life. If I survive or dead. And God
      help me, I survived," said Seykou.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      As the fighting worsened, all three men made the same choice that thousands of others in search of a better life
      make each year - to leave Libya and take the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean into Europe. The political
      climate in Libya provided a perfect opportunity for smugglers to move people freely across the Mediterranean
      into Italy. </p>

      <p>While the three men made their journeys at different times, they all suffered on their trips across the Mediterranean.
      Mudiaga said that he had brought biscuits and bottles of water to the port, but the smugglers ordered that he
      leave everything behind. For three days, he did not eat any food or drink a drop of water. He said he thanked God
      when an Italian boat rescued him and brought him to the tiny island of Lampedusa. He stayed in Lampedusa for 9
      days, Toroto? for 14 days, and then was re-located to San Giovanni.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Like Mudiaga, Seykou said he also didn't eat or drink for three days on the small fishing boat crowded with over
      300 people. On the third day, he fell unconscious. "I was there [on the boat] for three days. I was flat. Our water
      was finished. So by the time the Italy people came and rescued us, I didn't know how I ended up on the boat..So
      from there, I thank God because I don't die in the sea. Thank God nobody died in the sea."

      <p>
        Though the trips for both Mudiaga and Seykou were grueling, they both thanked God that nobody had died in
        their journeys to reach Italian soil. Sadly, Lamin's boat was not so lucky. "Our boat. We were 110 people in the
        boat. We were on the boat almost 7 hours. Our boat had problem and many people died. 55 people died in our
        boat. And 55 people survived...It's the God you know.. it was their time. The time that God opened their books
        and said this day you will die. So it's the God," said Lamin.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        According to the IOM 2,600 refugees have drowned in the Mediterranean this year attempting to cross to Italy or
        Greece.

      <p>Though the three men made it safely to Italy, Mudiaga, Seykou and Lamin still have a long journey ahead.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In Europe, there is a common set of rules for asylum seekers that apply to most of the EU member states."If you
      don't have documents, there is nothing you can do. Nothing. It's a big problem," said Mudiaga.

      <p>
        "The future is hard. Not for everybody. But right now, it is not good for us," said Mudiaga. Under the current
        asylum procedures, life for people entering Europe is very uncertain. Those who do gain asylum through the Italian
        system are left to find jobs and housing in a country with a low employment rate and discrimination against
        refugees. Those who do not obtain documents either have to return to their home country or live in Europe without
        documents, making it almost impossible to find jobs and assistance from agencies.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In XXX month, Seykou found out that he was denied documents from the commission. "For me, from the Commission,
        I have negative. I don't have documents. It is very difficult for me because now I face difficult things. It
        was difficult in Libya, but thank God I escaped from there. But in Europe, if you don't have documents, still now
        your life isn't back. So you cannot survive. I cannot stay here. I have to focus and do something or go to another
        country to get documents." In September we checked in with his housemate on Facebook and found out that he
        had left San Giovanni and was trying to find work in other parts of Italy.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        After years of waiting for a Commission date, Mudiaga had his commission hearing in July. While he waited to
        hear about the results, they gave him a small piece of paper that allowed him to walk on the streets without being
        arrested by the police. "For now, I don't know about my documents or if they will give to me. I don't know for
        now. It depends on your story, whether it is good enough. Why did you leave your country...that is the biggest
        question for you." We checked back in with him in September and he said that he had been approved for a 2-year
        document. When we asked if he had started looking for work, he said "The truth is in Italy it is hard to look for
        work especially with black skin. Luckily, I can stay in the project [SPRAR] for three months until I have to leave."
        He will stay in the apartment in San Giovanni through the SPRAR program until late December.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Lamin's commission date is in October. He hopes to stay in Italy, pursue his education, and continue playing
        soccer with a group of young refugees he has met through the progam. When asked him what he thinks his future
        in Europe may look like, he said "You know life is full of changes. I'm 18 years old. I want my future to be good.
        But right now, I cannot tell you I want to be this or that. Right now, I want to go back to school to educate. Because
        I'm 18 years old. I'm young...In Gambia, I wanted to be a journalist just like you."
