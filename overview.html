      The sun sets behind the Sicilian mountains, which rise across the Strait of Messina. The water is calm, reflecting the light of the sun and only
      interrupted by small sailing boats and a colossal metallic ship anchored between the sunset and the port. Hundreds of refugees are waiting onboard,
      their silhouettes clearly marked by the sun behind them. We are in Reggio di Calabria, a small city in mainland southern Italy, at the other end of the strait.
      For the past couple of years this ancient city–once home to the Greek, Roman and Byzantine civilizations among others–has seen a different kind of cultural influx.
      Thousands of refugees looking for better lives have arrived after
      crossing the Mediterranean in perilous conditions in an enormous exodus that has become part of the biggest wave of global migration since the Second World War.

        At the port, two worlds often divided by the sea are about to encounter one another.
        On one side refugees are staring curiously from the ship at those of us on the ground. Some afraid, some exhausted, some shily smiling back and
        some evidently excited to finally be so close to stepping on European soil, unaware of all the complications that
        they will likely face as they try to build a life in Europe. On the other, dozens of staff including Italian police forces,
        the Protezione Civile (the equivalent of the American National Guard), doctors, immigration officers and volunteers
         preparing for the arrival of yet another group of refugees. They have witnessed hundreds of sbarchi, as the landings are known in Italian.
         The procedure has become the norm for them, particularly in the summer months when the weather is ideal for traveling
         and as many as three landings can take place in one week in Reggio Calabria.

        The day before, the German Navy had rescued 627 refugees–115 women, 41 children and 430 men–near the Libyan Coast, and brought them to the Italian port.
         Most of them came from Eritrea, but Syrians, Nigerians and Gambians were also among the rescued.
         They had something in common: all were fleeing war-torn nations, poverty or political oppression– factors that have driven almost 60 million people away from
         their homes all over the world. For refugees from a wide variety of countries ranging from West Africa to South Asia, the Mediterranean has become the
         preferred route to reach Europe. So far, in 2015 alone, over 430,000 refugees have crossed the Mediterranean, according to the International Organization for Migration.
         That is twice the number of refugees that crossed the sea in all of 2014 and more than seven times the number that crossed in 2013. 
        Almost 3,000 people have died this year alone in the attempt–making the Mediterranean the most dangerous migration route in the world.
