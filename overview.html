      The sun sets behind the Sicilian mountains, which rise across the Strait of Messina. The water is calm, reflecting the light of the sun and only
      interrupted by small sailing boats and a colossal metallic ship anchored between the sunset and the port. Hundreds of refugees are waiting onboard,
      their silhouettes clearly marked by the sun behind them. We are in Reggio di Calabria, a small city in mainland southern Italy, at the other end of the strait.
      For the past couple of years this ancient city–once home to the Greek, Roman and Byzantine civilizations among others–has seen a different kind of cultural influx.
      Thousands of refugees looking for better lives have arrived after
      crossing the Mediterranean in perilous conditions in an enormous exodus that has become part of the biggest wave of global migration since the Second World War.

        At the port, two worlds often divided by the sea are about to encounter one another.
        On one side refugees are staring curiously from the ship at those of us on the ground. Some afraid, some exhausted, some shyly smiling back and
        some evidently excited to finally be so close to stepping on European soil, unaware of all the complications that
        they will likely face as they try to build a life in Europe. On the other, dozens of staff including Italian police forces,
        the Protezione Civile (the equivalent of the American National Guard), doctors, immigration officers and volunteers
         preparing for the arrival of yet another group of refugees. They have witnessed hundreds of sbarchi, as the landings are known in Italian.
         The procedure has become the norm for them, particularly in the summer months when the weather is ideal for traveling
         and as many as three landings can take place in one week in Reggio Calabria.

        The day before, the German Navy had rescued 627 refugees–115 women, 41 children and 430 men–near the Libyan Coast, and brought them to the Italian port.
         Most of them came from Eritrea, but Syrians, Nigerians and Gambians were also among the rescued.
         They had something in common: all were fleeing war-torn nations, poverty or political oppression– factors that have driven almost 60 million people away from
         their homes all over the world. For refugees from a wide variety of countries ranging from West Africa to South Asia, the Mediterranean has become the
         preferred route to reach Europe. So far, in 2015 alone, over 430,000 refugees have crossed the Mediterranean, according to the International Organization for Migration.
         That is twice the number of refugees that crossed the sea in all of 2014 and more than seven times the number that crossed in 2013.
        Almost 3,000 people have died this year alone in the attempt–making the Mediterranean the most dangerous migration route in the world.

        In 2011, Italy saw an abrupt influx of refugees from North Africa, when Colonel Gaddafi's regime was overthrown by opposition forces.
        Shortly after the revolution, a brutal civil war threw Libya into political chaos that continues today, allowing human traffickers to entice
        refugees to travel to Europe from the North African country. Since then, the numbers have spiked, with refugees from West Africa
        fleeing poverty and conflict, Eritreans an oppressive regime and Syrians a brutal civil war. Even refugees from faraway countries in South Asia,
        like Pakistan and Bangladesh, have made the trip to Libya to make their way to Europe.
        There are three main routes in the Mediterranean Sea alone. Until last year, the most popular one was the central Mediterranean, that connects
        Libya to Italy and Malta. This year however, the number of crossings via the eastern route, connecting Turkey to Greece, has increased fivefold,
        predominantly by Syrians who are desperate to flee civil war.

        In 2013 in response to numerous accidents at sea, the Italian government launched a rescue operation known as Mare Nostrum, that according to many,
        saves thousand of lives. The program was fully funded by the Italian government and proved to be unsustainable in the long term.
        In 2014, Mare Nostrum ended and was replaced instead by Operation Triton, funded by the EU. Operation Triton is the most recent rescue plan put in place
         by Frontex, the European Union’s border control agency. The EU has agreed to fund rescue operations through rescue ships, like the one operated by the
         German Navy that unloaded refugees in Reggio that afternoon. However, once refugees crossing via the central Mediterranean route are rescued at sea,
         they are brought to Italian ports regardless of the nationality of the rescue ship, where local authorities process them.

        It goes something like this: as soon as the ship arrives to the port, Italian authorities look for the captain or captains of the boat,
        who are taken to the police to be interrogated and charged for human trafficking (FACT CHECK). Slowly, the rest of the refugees start lining up and
        making their way out of the ship. Once on land, doctors and volunteers, wearing full body protective suits, are waiting for them to complete medical check ups.
         It is not uncommon to see migrants with scabies, for instance. Doctors direct those who are sick to special medical tents for further inspection.
         Unaccompanied minors, also known as UAMs, are also separated from the rest. This particular group of refugees has grown dramatically in the last couple of
         years. Italy has received UAMs from Eritrea, Somalia and Gambia.

        Apart from those who are sick or unaccompanied minors, everyone else is sent on a bus to the north of the country where there is a better infrastructure to receive
        such a massive influx. Typically, this means that most refugees end up in larger cities like Rome, Florence or Milan.
        Many, unwilling to stay in Italy because they know unemployment is high and protection programs are better in Northern Europe.
        Reggio Calabria is a major reception point for refugees in Italy, but not the only one. Cities like Palermo, Messina and Catania in Sicily have seen a similar influx.
        The southern Italian island of Lampedusa, which is closer to the Libyan Coast than to mainland Italy, has also been a major entry point to Europe for thousands of refugees.

        As foreign journalists, we stood at the port, unsure of how to make sense of what felt like a surreal and dystopian scene, strangely antiquated and colonial
        (SHOW; DON’T TELL). The number of refugees arriving in Europe over the past years has overwhelmed European governments, which have been unresponsive for way too
        long. The Mediterranean refugee crisis has been taking place for years, but only until now, when the numbers spiked dramatically and thousands of people have
        drowned in the Mediterranean, the situation has stirred public outrage and enough pressure has mounted to shake politicians to work on more urgent and responsible
        policies. Political stagnation is felt on the ground when local authorities and citizens face the tangible consequences and the chaos that come with refugee
        landings. This translates into understaffed teams, cultural insensitivity and lack of basic necessary infrastructure to deal with a crisis of this scale.
        A good example of this unpreparedness lies in the fact that Eritreans are one of the biggest group of refugees arriving in Italy every year.
        Yet there are no translators of Tigrigna, the primary Eritrean language. Unsurprisingly, no refugees speak Italian.
        It also means that the system that is currently in place is meant to process as many people as possible, in the least possible amount of time,
        which inevitably feels results in what feels like an inhumane scene from the colonial era.
